= An Amazon Alexa Skill Using AWS Lambda and the Strava API

*TL;DR:* I built an Amazon Alexa voice skill on AWS Lambda using the Strava API (and OAuth)

I got an Amazon Echo as a Christmas present (to myself...) and have been really impressed with it. I expected it to be a geek toy that nobody else in the house would use but it gets used a lot by other family members for things like spotify and interactive games (my 4 year old likes to try and beat Alexa at 20 questions!). I think the reason that it has gained such traction in our home is down to the quality of the voice interaction.

I wanted to see how difficult it would be it write an app (Skill) for Alexa. I use http://strava.com[Strava] a lot so I decided to see how difficult it would be to get a Skill to consume the API. I've outlined the steps in setting up the Skill and some of the code used to query the API.

.Before I get started, this is an example of the response from the skill: 
audio::alexa/MyActivity.mp3?raw=true[options=""]

_Disclaimer_
There's going to be lots of screenshots _(boo)_ of the AWS consoles for the first half of this post. The `code` _(yay)_ is towards the end.

==== AWS Lambda
The first step is to create a Lambda function that will host the endpoint for the Skill. 

.There are some templates available but I just started with a blank function.

.The second step allows you to select the triggers that will invoke your serverless function

.There are a number of predefined options available, choose the "Alexa Skills Kit" option

.Once a valid trigger is selected you can procede to the next step

.I chose the Java 8 Runtime but you can chose C#, Node, etc.

.You need to specify what the handler of your skill will be, this is the Java method.

==== Skill COnfiguration
Once the skill is set up and up and you have an http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[Amazon Resource Name (ARN)] to reference your Lambda function, you can set up your Skill to point at it.

You create a Skill from the http://developer.amazon.com[developer.amazon.com] portal

.*Skill Information* allows you to set the name of your skill and the name your users will use to invoke the skill (the invocation Name)

.*Interaction Model* is where most of the configuration for how users will speak to your skillis defined.

[%hardbreaks]
The interaction model is made up of *Intents*, *Slots* and *Utterances*. 
I defined 2 intents, one to allow a user to query their own activities and the other to query their friends activities.

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "ActivityType",
          "type": "LIST_OF_ACTIVITIES"
        }
      ],
      "intent": "WhoWasActive"
    },
    {
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "Direction",
          "type": "LIST_OF_DIRECTIONS"
        },
        {
          "name": "Date",
          "type": "AMAZON.DATE"
        }
      ],
      "intent": "MyTraining"
    }
  ]
}

Slots are like variables that Amazon extracts from the users request based on how the user invokes the intent.
There are built in slots like `AMAZON.DATE` and you can create custom slots too, `LIST_OF_ACTIVITIES` is a custom slot I defined.

.*Configuration* The configuration step allows you to set your AWS Lambda ARN or else configure your own enpoint

.*Account Linking* The account linking is where you can set up an OAuth client token request.
image:alexa/AccountLinking.png[]

Making the skill work with the Strava OAuth took a while to configure correctly but didn't require any code which was nice. Once this config is setup users get prompted to authorise the app from their Strava account
image:alexa/stravaAuth.png[]

Once the user authorizes the skill, Amazon takes care of requesting and refreshing the auth token. The token is supplied to your request handler with every invocation of the skill and you pass the token through to the API call. Painless.

==== AWS Eclipse Plugin



.To test the skill you can use the Service Simulator from the *Test* tab.

.Logs are available for the Lambda function in AWS CloudWatch.
